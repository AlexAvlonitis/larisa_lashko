            <p>Hello and welcome to my website, my name is Larisa Lashko, a realist painter from Belarus. I currently live
    in a wonderful island of Greece, Corfu.</br>
    When i was 10 years old i went to the first school of art in Belarus, i 
    studied for 6 years and after that i continued my studies at Minsk School 
    of art named after A.K Glebov in the field of Artistic Design. I have worked in different companies as a painter, i've painted on walls 
    of several schools and for friends. I mostly paint with oil colors, but i 
    also like pastel and watercolors. As a member of UNESCO I take part in many exhibitions around the world.</br>
    The paintings on my gallery are for sale, and i can paint on request any 
    personal photograph you would like. Please go to contact and send me an email with any 
    comments or requests. Thank you for your visit!</p>
